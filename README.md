# telegram-sticker-download-bot

A simple bot allow you to download telegram animated & regular sticker set & emoji set

## Why

The bot I was using to download sticker set is not working for animated sticker

## Run

1. Set the bot token in .env like this

```
TELOXIDE_TOKEN=00000000_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

2. `cargo run`

3. Send `/download sticker_set_name` to the bot

## TODO

1. ~~Read sticker name from a sticker / sticker link~~

2. Error Handling

3. Handle multiple sticker set from same user at once ?

4. Convert sticker to custom emoji
